## Program4 : Write a program to display  Operators in C 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a=10,b=50;

    printf("A = %d\n B = %d\n\n",a,b);

    printf("A + B = %d (Addition Operator)\n",a+b);

    printf("A - B = %d (Subraction Operation)\n",a-b);

    printf("A * B = %d (Multiplication Operation)\n",a*b);

    printf("A / B = %d (Division Opertion)\n",a/b);

    printf("A mod B = %d (Remainder Operation)\n",a%b);

    return 0;
}
```
**Output** :
 ```
A = 10

 B = 50

A + B = 60 (Addition Operator)

A - B = -40 (Subraction Operation)

A * B = 500 (Multiplication Operation)

A / B = 0 (Division Opertion)

A mod B = 10 (Remainder Operation)
```
